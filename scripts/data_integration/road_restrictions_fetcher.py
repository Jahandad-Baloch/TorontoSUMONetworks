1.2 Traffic Incidents and Road Closures
Data Source: Integrate the City of Toronto Road Restrictions API and Ontario 511 API.
Implementation:
Data Fetching: Create scripts (road_restrictions_fetcher.py, ontario511_fetcher.py) to retrieve real-time incidents, closures, and construction data.
Dynamic Network Updates: Modify the SUMO network (.net.xml) during simulation to reflect road closures and incidents.
Event Scheduling: Introduce events at random intervals to simulate unexpected incidents.

# Ontario 511 API
# Description: This script fetches the road restrictions data from the Ontario 511 API.
# We are interested in the data that is relevant to the traffic conditions, such as road closures, incidents, and construction data.

Ontario 511 API Documentation
The REST API provides simple interfaces to most of the data available on the Ontario 511 website. The REST API enables developers to access essential data on the Ontario 511 website including Events, Construction, Cameras, Road Conditions, Transit Hubs, Carpool Lots, Ferries, Service Centres, Travel Info Centres, HOT / HOV, Truck Rest Areas, Inspection Stations, Roundabouts, Seasonal Loads, Rest Areas, Alerts. This API enables developers to create mobile traffic apps for Ontario.

Notes:
Throttling is enabled. Ten calls every 60 seconds.
The following outlines the resources available via the Ontario 511 API.

API methods relevant to our project:
1. Events: Returns all traffic events.
2. Construction: Returns all construction projects.
3. Road Conditions: Returns current road conditions.
4. Alerts: Returns all alert notifications.

We will focus on the Events and Construction resources to retrieve real-time traffic incidents, road closures, and construction data.

API Endpoints:
1. Events: https://511on.ca/api/v2/get/event
2. Construction: https://511on.ca/api/v2/get/constructionprojects
3. Road Conditions: https://511on.ca/api/v2/get/roadconditions

# Idea of using the Ontario 511 API to fetch real-time traffic incidents, road closures, and construction data and integrate it into the SUMO simulation environment.
The idea is to create a script that fetches data from the Ontario 511 API at regular intervals and updates the SUMO network based on the received data. This script will be responsible for:
This script will be responsible for:
1. Fetching real-time traffic incidents, road closures, and construction data from the Ontario 511 API.
2. Parsing the received data and identifying relevant events.
3. Modifying the SUMO network (.net.xml) to reflect road closures and incidents.
4. Introducing events at random intervals to simulate unexpected incidents.
5. Introducing events when triggered by the received data or by the user to simulate planned road closures or construction.
6. Logging the fetched data and the modifications made to the network for analysis and debugging.
7. Implementing throttling to ensure compliance with the API rate limits.

Implementation Steps:
1. Create a script (road_restrictions_fetcher.py) to fetch data from the Ontario 511 API.
2. Parse the received data and identify relevant events.
3. Modify the SUMO network based on the received data.
4. Introduce events at random intervals for simulation.
5. Implement logging and throttling mechanisms.
6. Test the script with sample data and verify the network modifications.
7. Integrate the script into the main simulation environment for dynamic network updates.

Implementation Details:
1. We define a class RoadRestrictionsFetcher to handle the fetching and processing of road restrictions data.
2. The fetch_data method sends a request to the Ontario 511 API to retrieve real-time traffic events and construction data.
3. The parse_data method processes the received data and identifies relevant events based on predefined criteria.
4. The update_network method modifies the SUMO network (.net.xml) to reflect road closures and incidents.
5. The introduce_events method introduces events at random intervals to simulate unexpected incidents.
6. The log_data method logs the fetched data and network modifications for analysis and debugging.
7. The throttle_requests method implements throttling to ensure compliance with the API rate limits.
8. The test method validates the functionality of the script with sample data.
9. The integrate method integrates the script into the main simulation environment for dynamic network updates.
